### URI

chimas://[username@password:]<address\_or\_ip>[:port]/[resource][/item]

### ITEM REPRESENTATION 

We are thinking in making # represent boards (as in IRC)

Also like in irc we can represent operators as @ ()

Users with + (+user, like voices in IRC)

chimas://127.0.0.1/#myboard+is+cool (board id: 'myboard is cool')

chimas://127.0.0.1/+myuser (user id: 'myuser')

This is inly a sketch; we still need to improve it, like making chars for topics too.
